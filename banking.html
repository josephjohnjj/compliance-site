                            Once a person becomes an NRI, Indian law requires that they cannot continue to
                            operate a standard resident savings account. This is because regular savings accounts
                            are meant for residents and assume income is earned and spent locally. NRIs have
                            foreign income, different tax obligations, and may want to repatriate funds abroad,
                            so banks must channel them into specialized NRI accounts (NRE, NRO, or FCNR)
                            that comply with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations. Continuing a normal savings
                            account would violate RBI rules and create complications in tax and currency
                            regulations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When your residential status changes from resident to non-resident, your existing
                            regular savings account must be redesignated as an NRO account under FEMA regulations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you don't redesignate your savings account to NRO status after becoming an NRI:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You may face a fine up to three times the value involved</li>
                            <li>Daily penalties for continued non-compliance</li>
                            <li>Banks may freeze the account or flag it for violations during audits</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Compliance Requirements:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Must redesignate their resident savings accounts to NRO status within
                                90 days of becoming non-resident.</li>
                            <li> Submit KYC documents proving NRI status: valid passport, visa/work permit, overseas
                                address proof, PAN card, photographs.</li>
                            <li> Complete bank-specific forms for account redesignation.</li>
                            <li> It is also a good idea to close all dormant savings accounts. </li>
